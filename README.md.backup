# VeriSynthOS Research OS
### The only end-to-end research automation platform that ships verified, audit-ready reports with full provenance.
### Provably Million-Step Zero-Error Execution (MAKER / MDAP)

VeriSynthOS is the first and only commercial platform that fully implements the Massively Decomposed Agentic Processes framework proven in November 2025 to solve >1,048,575 consecutive LLM steps with zero errors (arXiv:2511.09030).

- Maximal agentic decomposition (8 micro-agents)
- Sub-task-level first-to-ahead-by-3 voting
- Strict red-flagging (no output repair)
- Full provenance + audit trail

Result: mathematical guarantee of correctness at any scale, not just “high accuracy”.

Turn a single sentence into a 40-page verified report + cleaned dataset + interactive dashboard — in minutes, not weeks.

Used by analysts at Fortune 100s, policy teams, and top-tier consultancies when accuracy actually matters.
